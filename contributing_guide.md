# Contribution
Contributing means to add some feature or changes to the already existing project by the means of pull request.
Contribution in Github is generally known as Open source contribution.

## Steps to Contribute in a Github Repository:
1. `FORK` the repository.
2. `CLONE` the repository to your local machine.
3. Set the main project repository from ehere you forked as `UPSTREAM`(It helps to track the changes in main repository,if any).
4. Ceate a `BRANCH` of your cloned repository.
5. Apply the changes.
6. `COMMIT` the changes and `PUSH` it to your forked repository branch.
7. Create a `PULL` request.

Now it is upon the owner of the repository to merge your branch with its main repository or not...

That's all,you become an `open source contributor`.

Happy contributing.
